# Google-Books

This Google Books application searches the google books API to search for books.

## How it Works
* To search a book, the user must simply type in the author or title and hit the search button. The page will populate with books related to the search word. The user can save books on their list. The saved button takes the user to the saved books.

## Tech used
* React
* Mongoose

// I was not able to connect to the mongo database to save/store books
// it is a single page but the saved vs the searched doesn't pop up
